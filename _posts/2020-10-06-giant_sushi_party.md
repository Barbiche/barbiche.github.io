In GIANT Sushi party, your goal is to earn money by creating the perfect sushi for your customers. Stack up your ingredients, click on the plate and let the travelator do his office! But take care that you don’t run out of space, or your delicious plates might be… stuck in the loop!

This game was a special one for me as my main contribution for it was the music, and not the dev (singly taken by [zoglu](http://zoglu.net/)). The overall game is in the end one of the finest and most complete jam entry I've ever made, with a very clear game loop, a lot of attention to the level design, and great polishing on graphics, audio and music. Unfortunately, it didn't really score in the results.
