_After a crazy socialite party night, George wakes up in the street… entirely naked! With no memories of how he found himself into this situation, there is only one thing he can do: reach a taxi as fast as possible so that he can go back home discreetly._

_No one needs to know about this awkward event…_

Notorious Bum is a stealth game in which you play as famous George, who must reach the taxi to go home while being completely naked. But the city is crowded with people: don’t get pictured, or your notoriety could fall down irredeemably!

We really pushed the knobs on the humor to the maximum with this game, implementing a fake Twitter screen with random naked pictures just to increase the overall funny atmosphere. Ultimately it was not indeed the finest game made, but we won a **3rd place in the Humor category!**
