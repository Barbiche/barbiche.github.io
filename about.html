<h1>About me</h1>

<p>I am a French software developer, currently based in Nice, in the south of France.</p>
<p>As an engineer, my main interests are game development and computer graphics. Also a VR/AR enthusiast (even if both are the same - change my mind). Basically I am interested in anything as long as it is creative and shiny.</p>
<p>I do really enjoy music, 3D modeling, history, getting lost alone in strange places, and beers.</p>
