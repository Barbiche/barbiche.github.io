# About

I am a French Engineer based in Lyon, France. 

I work as a Software Developer, specialized in game development and computer graphics, but I am not afraid to go way out of my comfort zone to get into new interests that fit my values.

On this website, you will find computer science projects alongside low-techs and sustainable livings works.
