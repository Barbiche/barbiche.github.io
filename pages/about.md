# About

![logo](/assets/img/logo.png)

I am a French Engineer based in Lyon, France. 

I work as a Software Developer, specialized in **game development** and **computer graphics**, but I am not afraid to go way out of my comfort zone to get into new interests that fit my values. Recently, I've experienced projects on **low-techs**, **sustainable living**, and **bakery / pastry**.

On this website, you will find some of my recent activities on all these various subjects.
